This is a module focusing on tracing energy-sensitive system calls.
 Generally speaking, a naive project for undergraduate thesis. Till 
now, no documentations for the project. Also, it is mainly for personal
use, so the scripts in the tree may not work in your case, if you 
really want to work on a fork of this project.

Thanks.
